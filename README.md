# Self-Flying Quadcopter
Creating a quadcopter that can hover by itself. Using a gyroscope and accelerometer to record position of the drone. Running Velocity based PID Loops to make the drone hover. Implimenting Statistics with graphs, rolling averages, gaussians, and more to eliminate noise from the sensors and optimize operations.
